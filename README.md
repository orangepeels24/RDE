## Note from the Developers
Please don’t get mad if you get rate limited after trying to download hundreds or thousands of reels at once.  
Instagram rate limits aggressively.

We recommend downloading *no more than 10 reels at a time*.

Rate limit prevention is currently being worked on.  
Stay tuned.
